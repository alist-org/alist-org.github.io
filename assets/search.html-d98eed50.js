It will create a new table, record the parent directory, name, and size of every object, but the search does not split words which means that match whether the keywords you enter appear in the name of object.

After the future version is repaired, we will inform you to use the new full-text search to build the index. If you are using <strong>sqlite3</strong>, you can use whichever you like.</li><li><code>bleve</code>: An open source full-text search engine.
